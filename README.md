# port-forwarder
PortForward.ps1 script works only in the presence of a WSL virtual machine like Ubuntu. It forwards ports on the host machine to the vm so if any connections are required from a LAN (Local Area Network) using the specific ports on the host machine, tihs script makes sure it does connect those ports to to VM.
